    <h1>Backtracking</h1>
    <p>Copyright Â©2002 by David Matuszek</p>
    <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>The usual <em>scenario</em> is that you are faced with a <i>number</i> of options, and you must
         choose one of these. <br/>After you make your <strong>choice</strong> you will get a new set of 
         <b>options</b>; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made.
          This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final state. 
          If you made a <sub>good</sub> sequence of choices, your 12<sup>th</sup> final state is a goal state; 
          if you didn't, it isn't.
    </p>
    <p>Conceptually, you start at the <ins>root</ins> of a tree; the tree probably has
         some good leaves and some bad <del>leaves</del>, though it may be that the leaves are all
          good or all bad. You <strike>want to get to a good</strike> leaf. At each node, beginning with
           the root, you choose one of its children to move to, and you keep this up 
           until you get to a leaf.</p>
    <p>Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice, and trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke the choice that got you here, and try another choice at that node. If you end up at the root with no options left, there are no good leaves to be found.</p>
    <p>This needs an Example:</p>
    <img src="treesearch.gif"/>
    <br/>
    <img src="pp.jpg"/>
    <br/>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li>
        <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li>
        <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li>
        <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li>
        <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
        <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li>
        <li>E is good. Congratulations!</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of 
        the possible sequences of choices we could make. There is also a data structure
         called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to tell us what 
         choices we have. (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking 
         on it is called depth-first tree searching.)</p>

        The backtracking algorithm.
    </h3>     
    <p>
        Here is the algorithm (in pseudocode) for doing backtracking from a given node n:
    </p>
    
    <pre>
        boolean solve(Node n) {
            if n is a leaf node {
                if the leaf is a goal node, return true
                else return false
            } else {
                for each child c of n {
                    if solve(c) succeeds, return true
                }
                return false
            }
        }
    </pre>
    
    <code>
        int main ()
        {
            int a,b;
            int sum = a+ b;
        }
    </code>
